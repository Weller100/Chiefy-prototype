I've made the following changes:
Created a /public/courses directory to store course thumbnails
Updated the CourseCard component to use Next.js Image component with proper optimization
Added construction-themed thumbnails for each course:
"UI Design Fundamentals" → "Blueprint Reading" with /courses/blueprint-reading.jpg
"Advanced React Patterns" → "Site Management" with /courses/site-management.jpg
"User Research Methods" → "Construction Planning" with /courses/construction-planning.jpg
Added a default thumbnail (blueprint-default.jpg) as a fallback
You'll need to add these images to the /public/courses directory:
blueprint-reading.jpg - An image showing architectural blueprints or construction plans
site-management.jpg - An image of a construction site with management activities
construction-planning.jpg - An image showing construction planning or scheduling
blueprint-default.jpg - A default construction-themed image
Would you like me to:
Help you source appropriate images for these thumbnails?
Update the course titles to be more construction-focused?
Make any adjustments to the thumbnail styling or layout?
