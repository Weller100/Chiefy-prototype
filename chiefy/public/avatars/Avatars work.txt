Add three number images...

You'll need to add three images to the chiefy/public/avatars/ directory:

architect.png - An image representing an architect (perhaps wearing a hard hat and holding blueprints)
developer.png - An image representing a development manager (perhaps in a construction site with a tablet/laptop)
construction.png - An image representing a construction manager (perhaps wearing safety gear and holding a clipboard)
I've made the following changes:
Added Next.js Image component import
Updated the avatar container with proper styling for images
Added Image components with proper dimensions and optimization
Set up the proper file paths for the avatars
Added overflow handling and background color for loading state
Once you add the avatar images to the public/avatars directory, they will appear in the rounded circles for each mentor.
